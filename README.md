======

In the provided zip you will find two jar files, one for windows and one for linux, and a src directory. The src directory contains all our resources.
To run the game type `java -jar platformer_linux.jar` (if you are running linux).

## Game controls

You can move the the player left and right with the *a* and the *d* key respectively.
Press *space* to jump, and press *enter* to attack in the direction you are currently facing.

When walking over a totem you will see a popup with the controls available to spawn the ghosts.

## Starting level

When you spawn in the game you start in a beginner level which has an exit to all the levels in the game. Walk into one of those levels to start playing.

## AI Training

We have added a live training feature to our program. You can see live training of an AI with or without GUI.
You can also choose to multi thread the training to get smart ghosts even faster.

If you run the jar with `-help`, you will see a menu that tells you which command line parameters are required for AI training
and how you can change the settings.
